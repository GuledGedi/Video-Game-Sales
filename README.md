Video Game Sales Regression Analysis

Data analysis project examining the decline in handheld gaming device popularity through statistical modeling

Project Background

Conducted regression analysis to understand the decreasing popularity of handheld video game devices compared to home consoles, using historical sales data from 1985-2015.

Challenges Addressed


Large dataset with 6,984 data points requiring careful preprocessing

Technical limitations in SAS Studio affecting complete analysis of home console data

Imbalanced data representation between handheld (4) and home console (11) platforms

Limited variables suitable for regression modeling

Contributions


Developed separate regression models for handheld and home console platforms

Performed data filtering and preprocessing to ensure analysis quality

Created detailed visualizations for sales distribution comparison

Identified key variables impacting global sales performance

Key Findings


Handheld model achieved R-squared value of 0.7387

Home consoles showed more consistent sales distribution over time

Marketing priority significantly influenced critic scores and sales

Technical limitations prevented full statistical comparison between platforms
